## DESCRIPTION:
## * This script provides LCRM scripts access to a subset of Lynx functions.
## * It manages variables and metric procedures used by the LCRM scripts when
## * running standalone or within the Lynx Design System.
## * 
## * Automation Variables:
## * The LCRM scripts utilize some variables for managing directory structures used
## * for log files, reports, and output data. These variables are hardcoded for correct
## * operation when running LCRM scripts standalone. When running the LCRM scripts within
## * the Lynx Design System, these variables are under control of the flow automation.
## * 
## * Metrics:
## * The lcrm_setup.tcl contains procedures to support extraction of metric information
## * about the design and system. These appear as METRIC strings in the log file. When
## * running within the Lynx Design System, these METRIC messages are extracted and 
## * transfered to a database server. The Lynx Manager Cockpit application can be used
## * to analyze and generate reports from the collected data.
## * 
## * Users of LCRM scripts need not modify any of the contents of this script or
## * related references contained in each task script. These Lynx Compatabile functions
## * work when in Lynx and when running standalone and do not add any appreciable runtime
## * overhead.

## Lynx System Variable. 
## When running in Lynx, these SEV* variables are configured in the GUI and saved
## in the system.tcl file. When running outside of Lynx, a number of SEV(*) variables 
## need to be set to values to avoid errors in some of the metric procedures.
## The environment variable LYNX_RTL_PRESENT is set automatically when Lynx is run and
## is used here to setup variables according to the runtime environment
