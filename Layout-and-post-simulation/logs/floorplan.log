## DESCRIPTION:
## * This script provides LCRM scripts access to a subset of Lynx functions.
## * It manages variables and metric procedures used by the LCRM scripts when
## * running standalone or within the Lynx Design System.
## * 
## * Automation Variables:
## * The LCRM scripts utilize some variables for managing directory structures used
## * for log files, reports, and output data. These variables are hardcoded for correct
## * operation when running LCRM scripts standalone. When running the LCRM scripts within
## * the Lynx Design System, these variables are under control of the flow automation.
## * 
## * Metrics:
## * The lcrm_setup.tcl contains procedures to support extraction of metric information
## * about the design and system. These appear as METRIC strings in the log file. When
## * running within the Lynx Design System, these METRIC messages are extracted and 
## * transfered to a database server. The Lynx Manager Cockpit application can be used
## * to analyze and generate reports from the collected data.
## * 
## * Users of LCRM scripts need not modify any of the contents of this script or
## * related references contained in each task script. These Lynx Compatabile functions
## * work when in Lynx and when running standalone and do not add any appreciable runtime
## * overhead.

## Lynx System Variable. 
## When running in Lynx, these SEV* variables are configured in the GUI and saved
## in the system.tcl file. When running outside of Lynx, a number of SEV(*) variables 
## need to be set to values to avoid errors in some of the metric procedures.
## The environment variable LYNX_RTL_PRESENT is set automatically when Lynx is run and
## is used here to setup variables according to the runtime environment

Warning: Cell instance U38 is not completely placed inside top block floorplan (FPHSM-1800)
Warning: Current cell: cell placement is incomplete and will be ignored (FPHSM-1829)
Warning: Pad cells edges are now open for terminal placement (FPHSM-0019)
Information: During terminal creation, some port-connected pins were detected as possible or likely candidates to be a PAD-type pin.  A tcl script, set_pad_attributes_on_cell_floorplan.tcl, has been created with a set_attribute command for each possible pin candidate. Some pins in this script may not actually be PAD-type pins.  Please edit this fileand correct any lines which are not correctly setting the value (true or false).  Then source this tcl script and then re-run the command which produced this message (place_fp_pins, initialize_floorplan, or initialize_rectilinear_block) again so that terminals are correctly processed.  The command has assumed that all candidate pins which are on padcells or bumpcells are to have terminals stacked onto the corresponding pins.  It has also assumed that all candidate pins which are on hard macros are to to have terminals created on the cell boundary.  If you are happy with these assumptions, you may forego the sourcing of the generated script and just accept the initial results .  If that does not give you satisfactory results, then use set_pin_physical_constraints to explicitly specify terminal locations. (FPHSM-1854)
Number of terminals created: 15.
